- Facade provides a unified interface to a set of interface in the subsystem.

- Facade is typically used for something high level composed of actions of several complicated subsystem. 
- You may write a VideoConverterFacade whose only job is to call some of the low level graphics and encoding libraries. It does not have any layer by itself, it just arranges the calls to the libraries in a meaningful way 
and presents to the client a simplified interface.
